# Avatar Tutor
Avatar Tutor is a SocialFi project built on SUI. Our goal is to create a fun and incentivized campaign for Web3 creators to share their knowledge and for Web3 users to learn information smoothly. By utilizing generative AI and an incentivized reward system, our project aims to spark a trend of AI avatars explaining Web3 knowledge, enabling people to quickly understand Web3 terminology, and attracting more attention to Web3 on social media.

# Notice
Due to time limitations during the hackathon, this is just a proof of concept. We will beautify the frontend and optimize pipeline in the future.

Because the costs of GPU resources, we have restricted AI functions on our demo page, Feel free to contact for your usage.

# Execution

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
